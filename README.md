# Object-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Yolo
Insect Detection and Monitoring with YOLO
This project focuses on the detection, classification, and identification of insects using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, this project is capable of real-time object detection, making it an ideal solution for monitoring and studying insect populations.

Project Capabilities

Object Detection: Efficiently detects multiple insects in a single image using the YOLO model.

Classification: Classifies detected insects into predefined categories with high accuracy.

Identification: Identifies and labels insects, providing detailed information about each detected insect.

Why YOLO?

The YOLO model serves as the backbone of this project due to its impressive speed and accuracy. Unlike traditional object detection models, YOLO frames object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities. This allows for real-time processing, making it perfect for applications where speed is crucial.

Key Features of YOLO:

Real-Time Detection: YOLO is extremely fast, capable of processing 45 frames per second.

High Accuracy: Despite its speed, YOLO maintains high detection accuracy.

Single Architecture: Unlike models that use region proposal networks, YOLO uses a single convolutional network to predict multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes simultaneously.
How It Works

Dataset Loading: The project begins by loading a dataset of insect images.

Object Detection: Using the YOLO model, the system detects insects in the images.

Classification: Detected insects are classified into their respective categories.

Identification: Each insect is identified and labeled, providing detailed information about the detected objects.

Performance Metrics: The system also calculates performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
